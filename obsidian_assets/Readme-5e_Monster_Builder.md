This is the [The Lazy GM's 5e Monster Builder Resource Document](https://github.com/crit-tech/LGMRD?tab=readme-ov-file) (LGMMBRD) in Markdown format for use in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

LGMMBRD is officially pronounced "Lymm Bard".

## Dice Roller plugin

Many of the Markdown files assume that you have the [Dice Roller](https://plugins.javalent.com/Dice+Roller/Dice+Roller) plugin installed. If you don't have it installed, you can still use the LGMRD, but you won't be able to roll dice directly from the document.

Dice rolls are inserted before all random tables.

## Fantasy Statblocks plugin

In the Statblocks folder, there are statblocks in a format that can be used with the [Fantasy Statblocks](https://plugins.javalent.com/statblocks) plugin. If you don't have it installed, you can still use the rest of the LGMMBRD, but you won't be able to see the statblocks in a nice format.

These can also be imported into your [Bestiary](https://plugins.javalent.com/statblocks/readme/bestiary#Accessing%20the%20bestiary).
